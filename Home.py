             Welcome to this GAA Analysis Guide! I thank you for stopping by and being
             a valued member of the analysis community here in Ireland and abroad. 
             
             This application aims to become a central analysis hub for analysts of all ages,
             gender and experience. It aims to help host all existing research, tools, accreditation
             processes, data visualisation techniques, metrics and more in one single document 
             for easy access. My ultimate aim is to have this application become a teaching 
             resource/tool to help improve the analysis, coaching and player learning experience
             and performance.
             
             Please feel free to contact me as I design and update this guide throughout the
             years to come. If you would like to contribute some of your existing research, a 
             new tool you have found, an analyst experience, a blog post, a new metric or
             whatever else, please do reach out to me at üìß rathkealex@gmail.com and I will add
             details to the relevant page.
             
             I hope you find this guide useful and I look forward to hearing any suggestions you
             may have.
             
             ** *Please note this application is constantly being updated* **
