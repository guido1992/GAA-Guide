             The GAA analysis space has grown widely in the last 5 years. This application seeks
             to be an 'Analysis Guide' for any newcomer or existing analyst within the GAA. It
             aims to help collate all existing research, tools, accreditation processes, data
             visualisation techniques, metrics and more into one document for easy access. It's 
             ultimate aim it be used as a teaching resource/tool to help improve both the
             coaching and player learning experience and performance.
             
             Please feel free to contact me as I design and update this guide throughout the
             years to come. If you would like to contribute some of your existing research, a 
             new tool you have found, an analyst experience, a blog post, a new metric or
             whatever else, please do reach out to me at rathkealex@gmail.com and I will add it
             to the relevant page.
             
             I hope you find this guide useful and I look forward to hearing any suggestions you
             may have.
             
             A special shout out has to be given to Praneel Nihar, who's guide I used in
