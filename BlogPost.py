             Not everyone has academic research ambitions. In fact, some of the smartest
             analysts, coaches and players I have worked with in sports outside of the GAA
             have no academic background. The way I see it, their ideas should not be less
             valued. 
             
             This page is designed to showcase all the non academic analysis that has been
             completed by practitioners and fans in the local analysis space. That is not to
             say that whoever has content listed here does not have an academic background - I 
             do not know everyone in the analysis commmunity personally.
