             There are numerous tools to use for any analysis process. Sometimes even a good
             old fashioned pen and paper system may do - I am certainly not joking. Moving 
             along swiftly (as the industry does as well), below I have made a list of analysis
             software tools that I have used in the past. All of the tools listed below do 
             more or less the exact same job and therefore I will not dwelve into the pros and
             cons of each...that is for you and the coaching staff (as part of your process) to
             decide upon. 
             
             Other factors you may want to consider - budget, technological ability, staff 
             count, time and what sort of return you want.

               yet still a very handy tool for coaches as they offer a variety of games and 
               session builders.
