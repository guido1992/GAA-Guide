             There are numerous tools to use for any analysis process. Sometimes even a good old
             fashioned pen and paper system may do - I am certainly not joking. Anyways, below
             I have made a list of a few analysis software tools that I have used in the past. All
             of the tools listed below do more or less the exact same job and therefore Iwill not
             go into the pros and cons of each...that is for you to decide on. You may be limited
             by budget, technological ability, staff count, time and so forth.
