             Are you interested in becoming a performance analyst within the GAA? The next
             question may be - **'where do I start'**?
             
             The pathways are wide and varied. I would argue there is no real barrier into the
             industry, except maybe financial but opportunities are available wherever you look.
             I know of analysts who have gone down the route of a University degree, others
             have gotten into a set-up by word of mouth and others have shown skills from another
             area that management staff have come to depend on, especially as data becomes more
             and more available in the industry.
             
             The step after joining a set-up might be, how can I become accredited?
             
             The process to become a GAA Accredited Analyst is fairly simple. I have included
             links at the bottom of this page which bring you straight to the application process
             and include further information of the requirements for each stage of the application
             process.
